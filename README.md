# 30DaysDataScienceChallenge

> A hands-on journey to master Python, NumPy, Pandas, and data analysis through **daily coding challenges and mini-projects**.  

## Overview
This repository contains exercises and challenges to build strong **core Python skills**, advance into **numerical computing with NumPy**, and handle **structured data with Pandas**. Each day focuses on practical problems to reinforce concepts and improve problem-solving abilities.  

## Structure
- **Days 1–5:** Core Python (data types, loops, functions, OOP, file handling, algorithms)  
- **Days 6–9:** NumPy (arrays, indexing, broadcasting, statistics, matrix operations)  
- **Days 10+:** Pandas (Series, DataFrames, indexing, aggregation, integration with NumPy)  

## How to Use
1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/30DaysDataScienceChallenge.git
